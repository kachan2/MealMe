## Project Summary

MealMe is a website that helps users to discover, track, and organize their recipes with a simple and user-friendly interface. Users can also receive recommendations based on recipes they’ve liked before, and have the option to filter recipes based on different factors. 
### Description: 
Oftentimes, it’s difficult to find a specific recipe that meets a person’s constraints. Whether it's a college student looking for a quick and cheap meal, or someone with anaphylaxis searching for a recipe without peanuts, it's annoying to scour pages of google searches to find a singular recipe that satisfies all their requirements. Our application provides a platform for users to discover and manage new recipes that meet their necessities. Based on interactivity with other recipes, our application will offer recommendations to users that they can “favorite” and add to their library to view later. These recommendations can be filtered using different tags, allergies, and inventory. Users can also add their own recipes to keep track of and to share with others. 

### Usefulness: 
Our application offers a platform for everyone to manage their recipe library, and refer to the recipe database based on their preferences on the ingredients. Users can specify their requirements and filter the recipes that meet their necessities. Users may also create and manage their own recipe library to store their favorite recipes, which can be shared among the users. In addition to that, our application will generate recommendations to users based on their favorite recipes in the library and the filter.
Current recipe applications or websites mainly teach you how to cook, with emphasis on processing the ingredients and cooking methods. People nowadays also share their cuisines on social media like Instagram. However, it is hard to tell the ingredients and complexity by the pictures. Our application will serve as a filtering and recommendation system to help you find the recipes that will be suitable for you. Once users have done that, they can naturally turn to the cooking website to look for tips for cooking.
